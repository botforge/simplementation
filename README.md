Clean implementations of papers I read for research in robotics + handwritten notes on them. It aims to offer well commented code that flows well. I vaguely structure these according to: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html

### 1. Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning, Mnih et al, <em>Nature</em> 2015.
* **Gist** : Use DeepRL and Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to achieve above human level performance in ATARI Games
* **Paper** : https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236.pdf
* **Algorithm/Techniques** : DQN, Experience Replay
* **My Notes** : 

### 2. Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning, van Hasselt et al, 2015.
* **Gist** : Illustrate vanilla DQN's tendency to overestimate Q-value's, and propose 'Double DQN' to use two seperate Neural Networks to select the action and evaluate its Q-value respectively. 
* **Paper** : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf
* **Algorithm/Techniques** : Double-DQN, Experience Replay
* **My Notes** :
