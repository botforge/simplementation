# simplementation
This repository contains several implementations of papers that I read during my research, along with my notes on them. It aims to offer well commented code that 'flows' well, ensuring that all who are familiar with the algorithms at a high level are able to follow along. I vaguely structure these according to: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html

### 1. Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning, Mnih et al, 2015.
