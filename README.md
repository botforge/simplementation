This repository contains several implementations of papers that I read during my research, along with my notes on them. It aims to offer well commented code that 'flows' well, ensuring that all who are familiar with the algorithms at a high level are able to follow along.

#### Algorithm : Q-Learning
#### Abstract
We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The
model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning,
whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future
rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We
find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses
a human expert on three of them
